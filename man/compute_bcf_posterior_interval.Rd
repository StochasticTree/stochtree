\title{Compute posterior credible intervals for BCF model terms}
\usage{
compute_bcf_posterior_interval(
  model_object,
  terms,
  level = 0.95,
  scale = "linear",
  X = NULL,
  Z = NULL,
  propensity = NULL,
  rfx_group_ids = NULL,
  rfx_basis = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_object}{A fitted BCF model object of class \code{bcfmodel}.}

\item{terms}{A character string specifying the model term(s) for which to compute intervals. Options for BCF models are \code{"prognostic_function"}, \code{"mu"}, \code{"cate"}, \code{"tau"}, \code{"variance_forest"}, \code{"rfx"}, or \code{"y_hat"}. Note that \code{"mu"} is only different from \code{"prognostic_function"} if random effects are included with a model spec of \code{"intercept_only"} or \code{"intercept_plus_treatment"} and \code{"tau"} is only different from \code{"cate"} if random effects are included with a model spec of \code{"intercept_plus_treatment"}.}

\item{level}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the credible interval level (default is 0.95 for a 95\% credible interval).}

\item{scale}{(Optional) Scale of mean function predictions. Options are "linear", which returns predictions on the original scale of the mean forest / RFX terms, and "probability", which transforms predictions into a probability of observing \code{y == 1}. "probability" is only valid for models fit with a probit outcome model. Default: "linear".}

\item{X}{(Optional) A matrix or data frame of covariates at which to compute the intervals. Required if the requested term depends on covariates (e.g., prognostic forest, CATE forest, variance forest, or overall predictions).}

\item{Z}{(Optional) A vector or matrix of treatment assignments. Required if the requested term is \code{"y_hat"} (overall predictions).}

\item{propensity}{(Optional) A vector or matrix of propensity scores. Required if the underlying model depends on user-provided propensities.}

\item{rfx_group_ids}{An optional vector of group IDs for random effects. Required if the requested term includes random effects.}

\item{rfx_basis}{An optional matrix of basis function evaluations for random effects. Required if the requested term includes random effects.}
}
\value{
A list containing the lower and upper bounds of the credible interval for the specified term. If multiple terms are requested, a named list with intervals for each term is returned.
}
\description{
Compute posterior credible intervals for specified terms from a fitted BCF model. Supports intervals for prognostic forests, CATE forests, variance forests, random effects, and overall mean outcome predictions.
