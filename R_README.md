# stochtree R package

**NOTE**: we are in the process of refactoring this project so that the R, Python, and C++ source code sits in the [same repo](https://github.com/StochasticTree/stochtree/).

## Getting started

The package can be installed in R via

```
remotes::install_github("StochasticTree/stochtree", ref="r-dev")
```
