Description: Flexible stochastic tree ensemble software. 
    Robust implementations of Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) 
    Chipman, George, McCulloch (2010) <doi:10.1214/09-AOAS285> 
    for supervised learning and Bayesian Causal Forests (BCF) 
    Hahn, Murray, Carvalho (2020) <doi:10.1214/19-BA1195> 
    for causal inference. Enables model serialization and parallel sampling 
    and provides a low-level interface for custom stochastic forest samplers.
