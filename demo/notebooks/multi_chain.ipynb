    "# Running Multiple Chains (Sequentially or in Parallel) in StochTree\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixing of an MCMC sampler is a perennial concern for complex Bayesian models. BART and BCF are no exception. On common way to address such concerns is to run multiple independent \"chains\" of an MCMC sampler, so that if each chain gets stuck in a different region of the posterior, their combined samples attain better coverage of the full posterior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea works with the classic \"root-initialized\" MCMC sampler of Chipman et al (2010), but a key insight of He and Hahn (2023) and Krantsevich et al (2023) is that the GFR algorithm may be used to warm-start initialize multiple chains of the BART / BCF MCMC sampler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operationally, the above two approaches have the same implementation (setting `num_gfr > 0` if warm-start initialization is desired), so this vignette will demonstrate how to run a multi-chain sampler sequentially.\n",
